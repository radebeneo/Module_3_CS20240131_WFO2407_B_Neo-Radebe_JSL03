# [JSL03] Project Submission: Which one is which? Declarative or Imperative?!

Loom Recording Link: [Insert Link]

# Project Overview

In this project, you will be presented with two JavaScript code examples, each demonstrating a different programming paradigm: imperative and declarative. Your task is to analyse these examples and determine which one follows an imperative programming style and which one follows a declarative programming style. 

You will present your reasoning for each example, record your presentation using Loom, and submit your findings along with the Loom recording to the Project Tab on the Learning Management System (LMS).

# Instructions

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Repo Link: https://github.com/CodeSpace-Academy/Module_3_StudentNo_Classcode_Group_Name-Surname_JSL03

1. Access the provided repository containing the starter code and presentation template.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Open the cloned repository in your preferred code editor.

## Step 2: Analyze the Examples

1. In the cloned repository, you will find two JavaScript code examples labeled "Example 1" and "Example 2."
2. Examine each code example and determine which one follows an imperative programming style and which one follows a declarative programming style.

## Step 3: Record Your Presentation

1. Use Loom (https://www.loom.com/).
2. Create a single video presentation for both examples that include the following:

   - Introduction of the example number.
   - Explanation of whether the example is imperative or declarative.
   - Detailed reasoning for your choice, discussing the code logic and style used in the example.
   - Mention any specific code structures or patterns that align with the chosen programming paradigm.
   
3. Keep each video presentation concise, with a maximum length of 2 minutes for each example. Your total recording time should not exceed 5 minutes.

## Step 4: Insert Loom Links

1. After recording, upload your presentation videos to Loom.
2. Obtain the Loom recording links for the video presentation.
3. Edit the `README.md` file in the cloned repository and insert the Loom recording links.
   
## Step 5: Submit Your Project
1. Commit your changes to the Git repository and push them to your GitHub account.
2. Ensure that the repository is public so that it can be accessed.
3. Submit the GitHub project link (URL) that includes your Loom recording link to the [JSL03] Project Tab on the LMS for evaluation.

# Project Evaluation

Your project will be evaluated based on your ability to:

- Accurately identify and differentiate between imperative and declarative programming styles.
- Provide clear and well-reasoned explanations for your choices.
- Present your findings concisely within the specified time limit.
- Follow the submission instructions accurately.

Follow the steps outlined above to complete the project successfully.

# Presentation Talking Points

Example #: 1

## Imperative Approach [2 Minutes]
1. **Step-by-Step Explanation:** 
   - The second example walks through the entire cooking process with detailed instructions for each action. 
   - The grill is preheated, the steak is seasoned, and a loop is used to monitor and adjust the cooking progress based on internal temperature.
   - The use of a while loop to track the steak's internal temperature and the explicit instruction to adjust the grill temperature based on the steak's weight demonstrate a step-by-step approach.
2. **Emphasis on How:** 
   - The code focuses on "how" the cooking is performed, with explicit control over each part of the process. For instance, the while loop ensures that the steak continues cooking until it reaches the desired doneness.
   - Variables like grillTemperature and steakTemperature are used to track mutable states, demonstrating a focus on low-level control of the cooking process.

Example #: 2

## Declarative Approach [2 Minutes]
1. **High-Level Process Description:** 
   - In this example, the cooking process is described as a series of steps in an array (cookingProcess), where each step is an object with key information about the action.
   - The focus is on defining "what" needs to be done rather than "how" to perform each step.
   - Each action is mapped out with no detailed explanation of the underlying mechanics of grilling or cooking. 
   - The logic behind how the steak is cooked or how seasoning is applied is abstracted away.

2. **Use of Data Structures:** 
   - The array cookingProcess is used to represent the sequence of actions in the steak-cooking process.
   - This structured representation allows each step to be clearly organized.
   - Instead of explicitly coding each action in terms of its mechanics (e.g., looping through temperature checks), the process is encapsulated in objects that simply declare what should happen at each step.

# Learning Outcome   
   - In conclusion, Example #2 follows the declarative style, focusing on "what" should be done through a high-level process definition, while Example #1 uses an imperative style by detailing "how" to perform each action through explicit instructions and state management.
